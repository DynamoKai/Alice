            Precision is so essential a component of comtemporary human life and
            existence that we seldom stop to think about it Simon Winchester's.
            The Perfectionist examines the relatively recent development of the
            notion of precision--the people who developed it and the ways in
            which it has shaped the modern world--and the challenges posed and
            losses risked by our veneration and pursuit of increasingly precise
            tools and methods.
          </p>

          <p>
            The history of precision as a concept and in practice begins in
            England with its originators: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph
            Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson
            who first exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States,
            setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. At
            the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, standards of measurement were
            established, giving way to the development of machine
            tools--machines thats make machines. Eventually, the application of
            precision tools and methods in the development of guns, glass,
            mirrors, lenses, and cameras, gave way to further advancements,
            including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.

          <p>
            The fundamental questions at the heart of The Perfectionist are
            these: Why is precision important? has the pursuit of the
            ultraprecise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other
            things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old
            traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing
            something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as
            we think we would wish it to be?
