    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
    <p>
      Within every woman there lives a powerful force, filled with good
      instincts, passionate creativity, and ageless knowing. She is the Wild
      Woman, who represents the instinctual nature of women. But she is an
      endangered species. In WOMEN WHO RUN WITH WOLVES, Dr. Estés unfolds rich
      intercultural myths, fairy tales, and stories, many from her own family,
      in order to help women reconnect with fierce, healthy, visionary
      attributes of this instinctual nature. Through the stories and
      commentaries in this remarkable book, we retrieve, examine, love, and
      understand the Wild Woman and hold her against our deep psyches as one who
      is both magic and medicine. Dr. Estés has created a new lexicon for
      describing the female psyche. Fertile and life-giving, it is a psychology
      of women in the truest sense, a knowing of the soul.
