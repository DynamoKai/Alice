          One the morning of Saturday, October 15, 1586, Queen Mary entered the
          crowded courtroom at Fotheringhay Castle. Years of imprisonment and
          the onset of rheumatism had taken their toll, yet she remained
          dignified, composed and indisputably regal. Assisted by her physcian,
          she made her way past the judges, officials and spectators, and
          approached the throne that stood halfway along the long, narrow
          chamber. Mary had assumed that the throne was a gesture of respect
          toward her, but she was mistaken. The throne symbolized the absent
          Queen Elizabeth, Mary's enemy and prosecutor. Mary was gently guided
          away from the throne and toward the opposite side of the roomm to the
          defendant's seat, a crimson velvet chair. <br />
          Mary Queen of Scots was on trial for treason. She had been accused of
          plotting to assassinate Queen Elizabeth in order to take the English
          crown for herself. Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's Principal
          Secretary, had already arrested the other conspirators, extracted
          confessions, and executed them. Now he planned to prove that Mary was
          at the heart of the plot, and was therefore equally culpable and
          equally deserving death. <br />
          Walsingham knew that before he could have Mary executed, he would have
          to convince Queen Elizabeth of her guilt. Although Elizabeth despised
          Mary, she had several reasons for being reluctant to see her put to
          death.
        </p>

        <div class="paragraph-list">
          <ol>
            <li>
              Mary was a Scottish Queen, and many questioned whether an english
              court had the authority to execute a foreign head of state.
            </li>
            <li>
              Executing Mary might establish an awkward precedent-if the state
              is allowed to kill one queen, then perhaps rebels might have fewer
              reservations about killing another, namely Elizabeth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Elizabeth and Mary were cousins, and their blood tie made
              Elizabeth all the more squeamish about ordering her execution.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
        </div>
        <p>
          In short, Elizabeth would sanction Mary's execution only if Walsingham
          could prove beyond any hint of doubt that she had been part of the
          assassination plot.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conspirators were a group of young Catholic noblemen intent on
          removing Elizabeth, a Protestant, and replacing her with Mary, a
          fellow Catholic. It was apparent to the court that Mary was a
          figurehead for the conspirators, but it was not clear that she
          actually had given her blessing to the conspiracy. In fact, Mary had
          authorized the plot. The challenge for Walsinghamwas to demonstrate a
          palpable link between Mary and the plotters.
