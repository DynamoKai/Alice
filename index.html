              Practically since humans began writing, they have been writing in
              code, and ciphers have decided the fates pf empires throughout
              recorded history. In <em>The Code Book</em>, Simon Singh offers a
              sweeping history of the subject of encryption. Combining a
              storyteller's sense of drama with a scientist's appreciation for
              technical perfection, he traces the evolution of its methods and
              reveals its dramatic effects on wars, nations, and individual
              lives. <br />

              From Mary, Queen of Scots, trapped by her own code and put to
              death by Queen Elizabeth, to the Navajo Code talkers who helped
              the Allies win World War II, to the incredible (and incredibly
              simple) breakthrough that made internet commerce secure, The Code
              Book tell the story of the most powerful intellectual weapon ever
              known: secrecy. <br />

              Woven throughout are clear technological and mathematical
              explanations, and portrayals of the remarkable
              personalities---many courageous, some villainous, and all
              obsessive---who wrote and broke the worlds's most diffcult codes.
              Accessible, compelling, and remarkably far-reaching, this book
              will forever alter your view of history, what drives it, and how
              private that e-mail you just sent really is.<br />

              One of the most famous literary works of the twentieth century,
              the novella "Death in Venice" embodies themes that preoccupied
              Thomas Mann (1875-1955) in much of his work: the duality of art
              and life, the presence of death and disintegration in the midst of
              existence, the connection between love and suffering and the
              conflict between the artist and his inner self.<br />
